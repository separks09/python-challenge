#Welcome to my UNCC Data Analytics Bootcamp assignment for our first week of Python!

#Couple of things:
#(1)I only ran one .txt file on each project.  I wasn't sure if you desired to test the code and see it
#output to the main folder for each project.

#(2)I was disappointed to only get to the minimum number of projects; if I have more time next week I 
#will go back and work through the other projects.  I struggled hard in the beginning of this
#work, but was satisfied with it in the end...

#(3)...except for the final loop buried in my print statement for PyPoll.  I could not get it to output 
#the last line of the loop, no matter what I tried.  I made up a clunky work-around for the last
#line, but am concerned about why that logic did not work.  If you can help me figure out what
#went wrong there, I would greatly appreciate it!
